CS50 AI Problem Set 0.1

TLDR: It is a program, that determines how many "degrees of separation" apart two actors are. 

To quote CS50 task :

In this problem, we’re interested in finding the shortest path between any two actors by choosing a sequence of movies that connects them.
For example, the shortest path between Jennifer Lawrence and Tom Hanks is 2: Jennifer Lawrence is connected to Kevin Bacon by both starring in “X-Men: First Class,” and Kevin Bacon is connected to Tom Hanks by both starring in “Apollo 13.”
